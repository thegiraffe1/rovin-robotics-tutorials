## {Step 1 @fullscreen}

Click on the ``||basic:Basic||`` category in the Toolbox.
Locate the ``||basic:show leds||`` block and drag it under the ``||basic:on start||`` block.

## {Step 2}
Write the first letter of your name with the LEDs by clicking on the little boxes in the block. White means the LED will light up! 

## {Step 3}
Connect your @boardname@ by USB and click the ``|Download|`` button. Follow the instructions to transfer your code onto the @boardname@ and watch it light up!

## {Step 4}
Now, under ``||basic:Basic||``, grab the ``||basic:show string||`` block and drag it into the ``||basic:on start||`` block, after the ``||basic: show leds||``block

Type in your name in the space provided and click ``|Download|`` to see your name scroll across!

## {Step 5}
Now add an icon to the end by finding the ``||basic:show icon||`` block under ``||basic:Basic||`` and dragging it to the end of the ``||basic:on start||`` function

``||basic:show icon||`` does the same thing as ``||basic:show leds||`` except that the design is premade instead of you having to draw out every single LED that lights up .

Click the dropdown to choose whatever icon you want and download the code!

## {Step 6}
Play around! What messages and images can you create?
