# Actions

## Make different designs based on what you do!

## {Step 1}

Drag a ``||basic:forever||`` block from ``||basic:Basic||`` in the Toolbox.

## {Step 2}

Go to the ``||logic:Logic||`` category and find the ``||logic:if then||`` block and drag it under ``||basic:forever||``.

## {Step 3}

Find the ``||logic:button A is pressed||`` block and drag it into the condition area of the ``||logic:if then||`` block.

**If** button A is pressed, **then** code in then will run!

## {Step 4}

Drag a ``||basic:show icons||`` block into the ``||logic:if then}||`` block. Choose any icon you'd like, then ``||Download||`` the code!

Remember, nothing should show up at first! Press button A to make it light up ðŸ’¡

## {Step 5}

Let's add more icons with more buttons!
Click the plus button under the ``||logic:if then||`` block to create an *else*. Click it another time to create an *else if*! âž• 

## {Step 6}

The *else if* now has an empty condition. We can fill it with another logic block, like ``||logic:button B is pressed||``!

Now, drag another ``||basic:show icons||`` block into the *else if* section. If you ``||Download||`` the code now, it should show the new icon when you press B!

## {Step 7}

What if we didn't want the lights to stay on? We can add a ``||basic:clear screen||`` block into the *else* section.

## {Step 8}

Try to add even more actions! You will want to add more *else if*s and use other logic blocks like ``||logic:is shake gesture||``.
